<p>If you  don’t have a direct connection to your accounting system, as long as the system accepts a CSV file, you can easily export your expense data for upload to the system. Custom templates are great if you want to analyze the data in your favorite spreadsheet program.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-use-custom-templates">How to use custom templates</h1>
<p>If you are a Group workspace admin you can create a custom template that will be available to all Workspace Admins on the workspace from <strong>Settings &gt; Workspaces &gt; Group &gt; <em>Workspace Name</em> &gt; Export Formats</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are using a free account you can create a custom template from <strong>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Preferences &gt; CSV Export Formats</strong>.</p>

<p>You can use your custom templates from the <strong>Reports</strong> page.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the checkbox next to the report you’d like to export</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Export to</strong> at the top of the page</li>
  <li>Select your template from the dropdown</li>

<h2 id="substring-formulas">Substring formulas</h2>
<p>This formula will output a subset of the string in question. It is important to remember that the count starts at 0 not 1.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{expense:merchant|substr:0:4}</code> would output “Star” for a merchant named Starbucks. This is because we are telling it to start at position 0 and be of 4 character length.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{expense:merchant|substr:4:5}</code> would output “bucks” for a merchant named Starbucks. This is because we are telling it to start at position 4 and be of 5 character length.</p>

<h1 id="faqs">FAQs</h1>

<p><strong>Can I export one line per report?</strong></p>

<p>No, the custom template always exports one line per expense. At the moment it is not possible to create a template that will export one line per report.</p>
